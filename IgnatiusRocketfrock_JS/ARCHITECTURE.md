# Ignatius Rocketfrock Architecture

This document is the directory and dependency map for the browser reference implementation and the planned C++ / Unreal Engine 5 port.

## Source classifications

Every implementation file belongs to one of these classifications:

* **PORTABLE CORE**: deterministic gameplay logic intended to have a close C++ equivalent.
* **SHARED DATA / MATH**: engine-neutral formats and transforms used by more than one major subsystem.
* **BROWSER ADAPTER**: browser startup, device input, timing, and connection of the core to presentation.
* **PRESENTATION ONLY**: Canvas drawing, visual asset loading, colour treatment, animation playback, and other non-authoritative feedback.
* **EDITOR ONLY**: authoring tools and their helper modules.
* **TEST ONLY**: headless, integration, and future cross-language parity tests.

The root HTML files are thin browser entry points. Their larger inline editor applications are still scheduled to move into uniquely named modules under `src/tools/level-editor/`, `src/tools/asset-editor/`, and `src/tools/character-editor/`. That extraction should be performed one editor at a time and must not be mixed with gameplay changes.

## Dependency direction

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
shared  ←  core  ←  browser
   ↑          ↑       ↓
   └──── presentation ┘
              ↑
            tools
```

More precisely:

* `src/core/` may import only `src/core/` and engine-neutral `src/shared/` modules.
* `src/shared/` must not import browser, presentation, or editor modules.
* `src/browser/` may import core, shared, and presentation modules.
* `src/presentation/` may import shared modules and read core state, but must not own gameplay decisions.
* `src/tools/` may import shared and presentation helpers, but gameplay code must not import editor code.
* `tests/` may import any layer for verification.

### Known temporary boundary violation

`src/core/simulation.js` currently imports `normalizeLevelColorMap` from `src/presentation/level-color-map.js` while applying editor-authored levels. This is intentionally documented as technical debt, not as an approved dependency. The normalized `LevelDefinition` work must remove this import and keep colour mapping entirely in authoring or presentation data.

## Current module responsibilities

| Module | Classification | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `src/core/simulation.js` | PORTABLE CORE | Authoritative fixed-step state, player physics, collisions, weapons, enemies, reactive objects, story state, level runtime conversion, serialization, and update order. |
| `src/shared/animation-data.js` | SHARED DATA / MATH | Animation schema normalization, sampling, interpolation, and pose blending. |
| `src/shared/level-transform.js` | SHARED DATA / MATH | Mirroring, rotation, placement geometry, hit testing, and atlas-node conversion shared by runtime and editor. |
| `src/browser/browser-input.js` | BROWSER ADAPTER | Keyboard, gamepad, mouse, and touch state converted into `InputFrame`. |
| `src/browser/game-bootstrap.js` | BROWSER ADAPTER | Asset and level loading, fixed-step loop, and connection of input, simulation, and renderer. |
| `src/presentation/canvas-renderer.js` | PRESENTATION ONLY | Canvas rendering, camera presentation, HUD, rig drawing, visual effects, and debug overlays. |
| `src/presentation/character-runtime.js` | PRESENTATION ONLY | Browser-side character project loading, rig normalization, animation selection, and ordered draw commands. |
| `src/presentation/level-color-map.js` | PRESENTATION ONLY | Normalization and cached selective hue remapping for environment atlases. |
| `src/tools/character-editor/*` | EDITOR ONLY | Reusable Puppet Forge project, animation, atlas, dirty-state, and view operations. |
| `tests/testbench.mjs` | TEST ONLY | Headless simulation tests, data tests, source-boundary checks, and browser-entry integration checks. |

## Reactive-object runtime boundary

Revision 100 establishes the first authoritative reactive-object path. Editor-authored destructible entities are normalized into `gameState.reactiveObjects`, while their atlas state remains in `world.entities`/`world.visuals` for presentation. A reactive object may contribute a dynamic solid while its current state is listed in `collisionStates`; state changes rebuild only that solid. Projectile movement compares swept impacts against enemies, reactive objects, and terrain and resolves the earliest contact. Health, state, collision flags, damage multipliers, and emitted events are portable-core data. Atlas frame selection and smoke drawing remain presentation concerns.

The first implementation remains inside `src/core/simulation.js` to avoid a behavior-changing extraction. When the core is split, these helpers should move together into the planned `src/core/reactive-objects.js` module and retain parity fixtures for health transitions, collision removal, projectile ordering, and serialization.

## Naming rules

* Use lowercase kebab-case filenames.
* Do not repeat the project name in every source filename. The directory path supplies that context.
* Use unique descriptive filenames rather than repeated generic names such as `app.js`, `view.js`, or `model.js` across multiple tools.
* Future editor entry modules should therefore be named `level-editor-app.js`, `asset-editor-app.js`, and `character-editor-app.js`.
* Keep explicit import paths. Do not hide dependencies behind large barrel files.
* Keep numbered asset filenames such as `ct_char_enemy_001.json`; asset IDs and source module names solve different problems.

## Planned portable core split

`src/core/simulation.js` remains the authoritative facade for now. As systems are next edited, extract them without changing behaviour into modules with clear C++ counterparts:

| Planned JavaScript module | Planned portable C++ counterpart |
|---|---|
| `src/core/core-types.js` | `RocketfrockCore/CoreTypes.h` |
| `src/core/game-state.js` | `RocketfrockCore/GameState.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/collision.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Collision.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/player.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Player.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/weapons.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Weapons.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/projectiles.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Projectiles.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/enemies.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Enemies.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/reactive-objects.js` | `RocketfrockCore/ReactiveObjects.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/story.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Story.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/level-runtime.js` | `RocketfrockCore/LevelRuntime.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/simulation-events.js` | `RocketfrockCore/SimulationEvents.h/.cpp` |
| `src/core/simulation.js` | `RocketfrockCore/Simulation.h/.cpp` |

The JavaScript and C++ implementations should preserve equivalent public functions, data fields, state-machine choices, update order, and fixtures where practical. Browser and Unreal presentation files do not need one-to-one parity.

## Stable parity boundary

The cross-platform contract is:

```text
InputFrame + fixed dt
        ↓
   stepSimulation
        ↓
GameState + SimulationEvent[]
```

The browser renderer and future Unreal presentation adapter may differ completely internally. Neither may become authoritative for gameplay motion, collision, AI, damage, level transitions, or saveable state.

## Tests and fixture direction

The project is explicitly configured as browser-style ES modules through `package.json`. Run the current suite from the project root:

```text
npm test
```

The script executes `node tests/testbench.mjs` and has no package dependencies.

Future language-neutral parity fixtures belong under `tests/fixtures/`. Both the JavaScript runner and standalone C++ runner must consume the same JSON fixtures. Tool-specific tests may later be split into uniquely named files under `tests/core/`, `tests/presentation/`, `tests/tools/`, and `tests/integration/`, while `tests/testbench.mjs` remains the aggregate entry point until that split is useful.
